The Arduino Line Following Car is an Arduino project where a small vehicle autonomously follows a line on the ground using sensors. The Arduino reads sensor data and adjusts the motor speeds to keep the car on the path. In order to run this device there needs to be C++. The code consists of pins being set up, calibrating the sensor and loops that keep the car on track. 



Components Needed:

Arduino Uno - 1
L293D motor driver - 1
IR sensor module - 2 
7.4 or 9V battery -1 
BO motor - 2 
Motor wheel - 2 
Castor wheel - 1 
Hobby robot chassis - 1 
Wires
Screw




 Inputs

1. IR Sensor Modules (2) These detect the line on the ground and send signals to the Arduino.

2. Power Supply (7.4V or 9V Battery) Provides the necessary power to the Arduino, motors, and other components.

 Outputs

1. L293D Motor Driver
Receives control signals from the Arduino and drives the BO motors.

2. BO Motors (2) Controlled by the motor driver to move the wheels and steer the car.
